# This repository contains the files (including the R code) needed to build a health economic simulation model for self-management interventions (SMI) 
# in type II diabetes. This model is developed as part of the COMPAR-EU project (https://self-management.eu/).

# Where to find all input parameters of the model:

# Patient (baseline) characteristics: baseline_characteristics.csv
# Discount rates: aux_functions.R
# Treatment effects: in R scripts to launch simulation (i.e., in the main function call)
# Duration of the treatment effect: in R scripts to launch simulation (i.e., in the main function call)
